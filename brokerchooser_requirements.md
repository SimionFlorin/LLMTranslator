# Assignment: Multilingual Translation Application Using LLM

## Objective
Develop a short Python application that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to translate our web page's content into multiple languages. The application should include functionalities for evaluating the model's performance. Evaluate the model using the provided dataset (translated_outputs.csv).

## Requirements for the Python application

### 1. Basic Functionality
- Implement a Python application that accepts input text in English and translates it into a specified target language.
- In some texts, there are placeholders for parameters, don't translate these placeholders. E.g: ['brokerName']
- The application should support translation into Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and Portuguese.
- Write a paragraph on how we should pick and prioritize languages to optimize our costs.

### 2. Evaluation
- Implement a method to evaluate the quality of translations, and explain your methodology.
- Evaluate the models on a Hungarian dataset translated_output.csv. (Hungarian language accuracy won't be considered.)
- Compare the performance with a baseline translator (e.g., Google Translate)
- Write some ideas on how you would improve the model in the future.

### 3. Code Quality
- Ensure the code is well-organized, readable, and follows best practices for Python development.
- Include documentation on how to set up and run the application

### +1. Optional User Interface
- A web interface for users to input text and select the target language.
- Display the translated text to the user.

## Deliverables
1. Source code in Github. Optionally, Docker file for the environment. 
2. A brief report (in PDF format) on the evaluation results, and your insights.

## 2. AI in product ideas
After finishing BrokerChooser's translation engine, BrokerChooser's CEO asks you to pitch new possible AI-based developments/tools/solutions you would initialize to BrokerChooser, and explain the business potentials and risks. Write a summary of your opinion.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your innovative solutions!
